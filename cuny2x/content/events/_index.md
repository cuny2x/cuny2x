{{% notice info %}}

In this Four-part seminar we go beyond the traditional Computer Science curriculum to explore different, but related, subjects that help prepare us for a career centered on computer technologies and information systems. We start with some tips on getting a job and keeping it. The importance of effective communication and collaboration with our co-workers cannot be overstated. Then we explore the ways in which our skills may be applied and adapted over time to meet the needs of an organization and help us achieve the advancement we deserve.

#### Data Science in the Age of Artificial Intelligence Seminar ![cuny2x](/images/data.png?width=10pc)

{{% notice info %}}
In October 2012, Harvard Business Review described data scientist as “the sexiest job of the 21st century.”  In November 2022, ChatGPT was launched, which has vastly changed the tech world ever since.  The goal of this series is to inform and prepare citizens in this fast-changing employment market.  In 4 workshops, participants will learn how to use R (an open-source software for statistical computing and graphics) which is a most popular environment used by the majority of data scientists.  They will also be exposed to other computer programs including Python, MATLAB, Maple, and Wolfram Mathematica that professional data scientists utilize.  Bayesian modeling will be a focus.  The concept of quantum computing and its impact on cryptographic systems will be introduced.  Because AI excels at automation and computation, human-centric skills will be emphasized, such as evaluating and interpreting AI models.  By understanding the strengths of AI and developing human-centric data science skills, students will become well-positioned for future career success. 
The workshop will take place on 4 Monday afternoons.
