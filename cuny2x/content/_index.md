#### About

CUNY 2X career program at LaGuardia Community College will help all students find an Internship, Apprenticeship, or job to launch their careers. Our mission is to assist students and alumni in identifying their career goals and securing employment that fulfills them. We help every step of the way. 

The CUNY 2X Tech initiative is expanding access to internships in tech firms, boosting employment outcomes for undergraduates, bringing industry expertise into classrooms.

#### Approach & Objectives

CUNY 2x Tech’s approach to doubling the number of tech associate degree awarded and increasing students’ ability to secure and succeed in tech jobs is focused on building the capacity of Computer Science Departments. We will work together with the City and industry partners to decrease time to graduation and increase alignment of education with the preparation needed to succeed in today and tomorrow’s tech jobs. Specific objectives include: 

+ Updated Instruction: Increase departmental capacity to get students through the CS associate’s degree program, by removing course bottlenecks. Recruit and equip tech professionals to serve as industry adjuncts, delivering up-to-date content on in-demand emerging technology and their applications in the real world.

+ Tech-Specific Advising: Ensure students have insight into the tech ecosystem, potential careers, hiring cycles, and which courses, co-curricular activities, projects, and work experiences they should take pursue – and at what time - in order to successfully pursue specific careers following graduation by providing tech-specific advising. Establish mechanism for colleges to gain insight into the preparedness of students for post-graduate careers and where students are encountering obstacles to advancement to graduation and jobs.

+ On-the-Job Experience: Ensure students have the skills, exposure, and preparation needed to secure and succeed in tech internships at companies that have capacity to convert internships into full time offers. Build capacity for departments to maintain a constant feedback loop with industry in order to understand how interns from the college meet employers’ evolving needs and to make appropriate changes to courses and co-curricular services as a result.
